		<h1>This guy gets it!!!!</h1>
		<p>My name is Jeffrey Brink, and I am a student in the Deep Dive Coding Academy.</p>
		<p>I hope to be a front end web developer, where I can put my creativity to work.</p>
		<p>While exploring development tools I found these logos and thought I would add them.</p>
		<p>Margins, spacing, padding and such are still a mystery to me so it's a little off. </p>
